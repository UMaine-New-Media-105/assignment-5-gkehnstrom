A5Q1~ For question one I was tasked to draw 5 bubbles on my canvas, so I did made them jus "vibrate" on the screen, but sometimes you cant see all 5 of the bubbles on the canvas so you have to restart the code and it'll show all the bubbles, its just off the side of the screen. I used a let function and a class to complete this task.

A5Q2~ For question two I was tasked to edit my code I just had to tweak the code so that there are 50 bubbles on the canvas all vibrating around randomly, also everytime you restart the code they all spawn in differently each time.

A5Q3~ For question three I was tasked to add some stuff to my already existsing code, populating my sim. This is where we really start to create the game in p5.js, for my breeder catchers I chose to use a fish sprite I had previously made and use a simple boat design that I created on the spot for the catchers. The boats are going back and fourth chasing the fish. All of these sprites are created under a class so that I can easy tweak them on the fly unlike a funciton its a little more complicated.

A5Q4~ For question four I was tasked to activate my breeders and use a collsion function so that when 2 fish were on the canvas and they came in contact with any other fish it will create a new fish that does the same exact thing as all the other fishies.

A5Q5~ For question 5 we had to do a very similar task like question 4, we had to activate the catchers which in my simulation I made them boats, the boats had to go back and fourth across the screen and when they had a collision with a fish the fish had to disappear from the screen like it "killed" it. yet again this is done with a collision function
